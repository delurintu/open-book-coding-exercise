Task A.

- I wanted to create a RegEx to validate the form input
- The commonExpressionsRegExp only validates the common expression, i created one for the advanced expression (sin, cos and tan) but for now doesn t work properly

Task B.

- i used spilt() method with a regex to separate the expression and put the elements in an array to use the slice() to extract the them.
- i verified the each element and make the calculation where it finds correct operators
- for now this works for common operators

// TODO, extend funtionality for advandes operators (sin,cos and tan)
